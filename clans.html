                            The Aburame Clan (Aburame Ichizoku) is one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure.
                            At birth, members of this clan are offered to several special breeds of insects as a nest,
                            residing just under their host's skin.
                            These insects will then live in symbiosis with their host from that point on. Because of
                            this, its members are characterised by their use of insects as weapons.
                            The clan members may also carry additional insects in jars or gourds with them on missions.
                            The insects can leave and enter their host's body through various pores.
                            They feed on chakra as a food source, making them quite deadly.
                            The relationship between the shinobi and the insects is mutually beneficial.
                            The host grants the insects shelter and allows them to feed off their chakra, their body
                            becoming a living hive of tens of thousands of these insects,
                            and in return the insects do the user's bidding, allowing the shinobi to perform
                            ninjutsu-like techniques without the use of hand seals or chakra conversion.
                            A major defining trait of the Aburame clan is that all of its known members' eyes are
                            obscured usually by glasses,
                            as well as they wear clothing that usually cover up most of their body.

                            The Akimichi Clan (Akimichi Ichizoku) is one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure.
                            Many of their clan's techniques revolve around the manipulation of their bodyweight and size
                            through the use of Yang Release.
                            It has had fifteen family heads, with Chōza Akimichi being the fifteenth. Chōji Akimichi is
                            slated to become the sixteenth head.
                            Members of the clan possess great physical strength and are able to quickly convert calories
                            into chakra, which they then use in their various secret techniques.
                            Most of these techniques rapidly consume the user's chakra during use, and maintaining them
                            during a prolonged battle can be tiring.
                            For this reason the Akimichi have high chakra levels and eat a lot in order to build up or
                            replenish their chakra reserves.

                            Renowned ninja that belong to this clan are: Konoha's White Fang (Konoha no Shiroi Kiba)
                            Sakumo, and his son Copy Ninja Kakashi (Kopī Ninja no Kakashi).
                            The latter would later become the Sixth Hokage following the end of the Fourth Shinobi World
                            War.
                            The clan possess a heirloom called the White Light Chakra Sabre, which produces white chakra
                            when swung.

                            The Hyūga Clan (Hyūga Ichizoku) is one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure, as well as
                            the strongest clan in the village.
                            All members born into this clan possess the Byakugan, a kekkei genkai that gives them
                            extended fields of vision and the ability to see through solid objects and
                            even the chakra circulatory system, amongst other things.
                            Members of this clan also possess an innate ability which allows them to expel chakra from
                            any of the tenketsu in their body.
                            The Hyūga clan are descendants from the Ōtsutsuki clan, specifically from Hamura Ōtsutsuki's
                            lineage.
                            As a result, they are also distant cousins of the Uchiha, Senju, Uzumaki, and Kaguya clans.
                            They are considered to be one of, if not currently, the most powerful clan in Konohagakure.
                            Their fame and prowess stretches far and wide, leading others to both praise and covet their
                            abilities.

                            The Inuzuka Clan ( Inuzuka Ichizoku) or Inuzuka Family (Inuzuka-ke) is a family of shinobi
                            in Konohagakure known for their use of ninken as fighting companions
                            and are easily identified by the distinctive red fang markings on their cheeks.
                            The shinobi and canine allies fight using Cooperation Ninjutsu, such as the Fang Passing
                            Fang or Fang Rotating Fang techniques amongst others,
                            that take advantage of their teamwork and their sharp claws and teeth.
                            The clan members are also able to communicate with canines even if the dogs cannot talk.
                            The members of this clan, much like their canine partners, have greatly enhanced senses,
                            especially their sense of smell.
                            By concentrating chakra to their noses, this sense is amplified to an even greater extent
                            allowing the user to be able to detect,
                            track and monitor targets from a fairly long distance away.
                            The clan's fighting style primarily revolves around their enhanced speed, strength and
                            agility granted by
                            the Four Legs Technique and other canine-based attacks, in conjunction with the tactical
                            advantages granted by their heightened senses.

                            Konohagakure.
                            They are known for tending deer and their ability to manipulate shadows through the use of
                            Yin Release.
                            Two of its members, Shikaku and his son Shikamaru, are well known for their high-level of
                            intelligence, and both have served as advisors to the Hokage.
                            After Shikaku's death, Shikamaru became the head of the clan.
                            The Nara clan has a special relationship with the Akimichi and the Yamanaka clan.
                            For several generations, members of these three families have formed "Ino–Shika–Chō" trios,
                            named after the first part of the names of the members
                            with the Nara members being the "Shika" in the trio.

                            The Sarutobi Clan (Sarutobi Ichizoku) is an influential clan from Konohagakure.
                            It has produced several renowned members who have held positions of high authority,
                            including the Third Hokage; whose son, Asuma,
                            held membership in the Twelve Guardian Ninja, while his other child served directly under
                            the Hokage along with their spouse as Anbu.
                            All known members have also been devout observers of the Will of Fire.
                            After Konohagakure's formation following the Warring States Period, the Sarutobi were
                            amongst the first set of clans to ally themselves with
                            the Senju and Uchiha-founded village, alongside the Shimura clan.
                            The Sarutobi are famous for their high willpower, and exceptional strength.
                            The clan also uses hidden ninjutsu involving the Fire Release nature transformation.

                            The Senju Clan (Senju Ichizoku) was one of the clans responsible for founding the first
                            shinobi village: Konohagakure — the other being their rival Uchiha clan.
                            Although the clan itself no longer appears to exist as a group, the Senju continue to
                            influence Konoha's politics through their philosophy of the Will of Fire and
                            the corresponding interpretation of the role of the Hokage position.
                            As such, three Senju have achieved the position of Hokage.
                            As descendants of Asura Ōtsutsuki, the Senju inherited his powerful life force and chakra,
                            and through Hashirama Senju eventually manifested as Wood Release.
                            Compared to other shinobi clans, the Senju didn't specialise in one area, instead mastering
                            ninjutsu, taijutsu, and genjutsu to give them a wide variety of skills
                            to combat their enemies.
                            Due to this they acquired their name,"Senju" (literally meaning: "a thousand skills", "a
                            thousand hands"), in reference to their being "the clan with a thousand skills"
                            ("sen no te o motsu ichizoku").

                            The Uchiha Clan (Uchiha Ichizoku) is one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure, reputed to
                            be the village's strongest because of their Sharingan and natural battle prowess.
                            After helping found Konoha decades ago, the Uchiha grew increasingly isolated from the
                            village's affairs, culminating in most of their deaths during the Uchiha Clan Downfall.
                            Few Uchiha now survive into the present day.
                            The Uchiha are descendants of Indra Ōtsutsuki, the elder son of Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki.
                            Through Indra, the Uchiha inherited Hagoromo's "eyes", granting them powerful spiritual
                            energy and chakra.
                            As part of the so-called "Curse of Hatred" first displayed by Indra, Uchiha are subject to
                            powerful emotions: these emotions typically start as love for a friend or
                            family member that then become overpowering hatred when the object of their love is lost.
                            This loss, whether actually experienced or merely threatened, awakens an Uchiha's Sharingan.
                            It is due to the Sharingan that the
                            Uchiha have received much of their fame and notoriety.

                            The Uzumaki Clan (Uzumaki Ichizoku) is formerly a prominent clan in Uzushiogakure.
                            Since its disbandment, most of its known members reside in Konohagakure.
                            The Uzumaki, being descendants of Asura Ōtsutsuki, also shared distant blood relation with
                            the Senju clan.
                            Through the years, the Uzumaki and Senju kept close ties, with members at times marrying
                            between clans, as with Hashirama Senju and Mito Uzumaki.
                            Following the founding of Konohagakure at the end of the Warring States Period, the Senju
                            chose to symbolise their clans' friendship by adding the
                            Uzumaki's emblem to Konoha's flak jackets.
                            Konoha and the Uzumaki's own Uzushiogakure remained close allies over the following decades,
                            with the Uzumaki providing fūinjutsu (among other things) to
                            Konoha whenever there was a need.
                            In time, the Uzumaki Clan's Mask Storage Temple was even constructed on Konoha's outskirts.

                            The Yamanaka Clan (Yamanaka Ichizoku) is a family of shinobi found in Konohagakure.
                            They specialise in mind related techniques, and they own and run a flower shop in the
                            village.
                            They traditionally lead the Konoha Barrier Team.
                            The members of this clan specialise in mind-related techniques which makes them experts at
                            intelligence gathering, espionage and interrogation amongst other things.
                            They have also displayed sensory abilities and their techniques include transferring their
                            consciousness, reading minds and communicating telepathically.
                            The flower symbol of this clan is the bush clover which symbolises a "positive love".
                            Most members of the Yamanaka clan wear their hair in a long ponytail, which appears to be
                            traditional.
