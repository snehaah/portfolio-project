                    <p>
                        Konohagakure also known as “Village Hidden in the Leaves” or "Hidden Leaf Village” is the hidden
                        village of the Land of Fire. As the village of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries, Konoha
                        has a Kage as its leader known as the Hokage, of which there have been six in its history.
                        Konoha resides deep within a forest at the base of a mountain known as the Hokage Rock, which
                        has the faces of all those who have taken the office of Hokage engraved on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is surrounded on all sides by enormous walls that makes it an impregnable fortress. While
                        generally seen as the most powerful of the ninja villages, Konoha has enjoyed many years of
                        relative peace and stability. The standard attire for Konoha shinobi consists of blue or black
                        shirts, along with matching-colored pants under a green flak jacket which also has a red swirl
                        on the back, and pockets on the chest area. They also tend to wrap bandages around their legs.
                        Many Konoha shinobi use Fire Release techniques.

                <div class="section-text">
                    <p>
                        During the Warring States Perioid, shinobi were organised into small mercenary clans that knew
                        nothing but battle. The two strongest of these clans were the Senju and the Uchiha, who had
                        warred against each other for their entire histories. Eventually, intending to end the constant
                        bloodshed, Hashirama Senju used his position as leader of his clan to broker a truce with the
                        Uchiha clan through their leader, his childhood friend Madara Uchiha. Thus the Senju, the
                        Uchiha, and their respective affiliated clans formed the first shinobi village: Konohagakure — a
                        name invented by Madara himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hashirama used his Wood Release abilities to produce much of the village's infrastructure. This
                        ability and his ideals were two of the reasons he was chosen to become the village's leader: the
                        Hokage. Madara, however, feared that the Senju would oppress his clan and attempted to gather
                        support to overthrow Hashirama. No Uchiha would help, forcing him to take on Hashirama by
                        himself. Madara was ultimately defeated at what would be called the Valley of the End and he was
                        believed to have died. As a result of the battle, Konoha came into possession of the Nine-Tails.
                        To contain its enormous power, the village began its trend of sealing the beast within the
                        Uzumaki, a clan that the Senju and thus the rest of Konoha had close ties with.

                                            The Hokage Rock is a mountain overlooking Konoha that has all the faces of
                                            the Hokage carved into the stone. It was envisioned by Hashirama Senju as a
                                            symbol that the Hokage would always watch over the village. The Hokage Rock
                                            is easily the most identifiable feature in the village, such that when the
                                            village was destroyed during Pain’s assault, only the presence of the Hokage
                                            Rock (undamaged by the destruction) confirmed to others that the rubble was

                                            The Academy (Ninja School) is a huge building in Konohagakure located
                                            directly at the base of the Hokage Mountain. It is where prospective ninja
                                            are trained and where official ninja receive their assignments. It was
                                            founded by the Second Hokage out of military necessity. The Academy is quite
                                            large and is comprised of several buildings which were erected over time.
                                            The building can be identified by the tree in front of it which has a swing
                                            on it and more so, by the giant sign with the kanji for "fire" on it.

                                            The Dango Shop (Dumpling Shop) is a popular, well-known Dango Shop in Konoha
                                            that's famous for its dango. Anko Mitarashi, who has the sweetest tooth in
                                            the village, visits this shop often. Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshigaki
                                            stopped here for tea, on Kisame's suggestion, when they came to Konoha to
                                            hunt for Naruto Uzumaki, but had to flee since Kakashi Hatake was supposed
                                            to meet up with Sasuke Uchiha here. The shop serves many other desserts that
                                            use dango in them, such as anmitsu, a popular Japanese dessert that is
                                            served in a bowl consisting of red bean paste, small cubes of agar jelly,
                                            and pieces of fruit served with syrup, as seen when Sakura Haruno went there
                                            and ate anmitsu. The shop's sign is in a form of a stick with white-coloured
                                            dango run through it. The hiragana for dango is painted red (sometimes blue)
                                            on them. The inside of the shop is simple with wooden tables,
                                            rectangular-shaped lights, and menus that hang all over the walls for
                                            customers to look at.

                                            The Konoha Aviary is a building in Konoha where messenger birds such as
                                            hawks deliver messages, and also rest after delivery. They work very closely
                                            with the Konoha Cryptanalysis Team, and these messages that these birds
                                            transport are also received and dispatched from here. The aviary is a
                                            circular building built into the top of a tall tree with a spiral staircase.
                                            It consists of multiple bird cages lining the walls where the birds stay. It
                                            also has a long brown table in the middle, a circular platform on the ground
                                            where the ninja can sit while waiting for a message to arrive, and in the
                                            front is a U-shaped platform where the birds perch when they arrive at the
                                            aviary. The aviary was destroyed during Pain’s assault on Konoha.

                                            it was for, prompting Naruto to change his mind. Kakashi spends much of his
                                            free time at the monument because his former comrade, Obito Uchiha has his
                                            name engraved there.

                                            The Naka Shrine (Shrine of Southern Joy) is a shrine that the Uchiha clan
                                            originated from. It's located in Konohagakure’s Uchiha District and is the
                                            home to the clan's patron deity. In the main hall, beneath the seventh
                                            tatami mat from the far right, is a secret meeting place of the Uchiha clan.
                                            There stood a stone monument which contains the clan's secrets and can only
                                            be read with specific dojutsu. The upper level of the shrine was destroyed
                                            during Pain’s assault on Konoha, though the secrets hidden below remained
                                            untouched and was later accessed by Taka and Orouchimaru during the Fourth
                                            Shinobi World War. In order to access the main hall, Sasuke Uchiha had to
                                            use a sequence of seals to remove the sealing stone that lays atop the
                                            entranceway. The seal itself has the Sharingan in the middle.

                                            Ramen Ichiraku (Ramen is the Best Pleasure) is a ramen restaurant in
                                            Konohagakure. Ramen Ichiraku was founded by Teuchi. Although it is quite
                                            small and has an unassuming appearance, Ramen Ichiraku has always been
                                            popular with Konoha's villagers because of Teuchi's strong commitment to
                                            taste, giving the ramen an almost artistic quality. Like any ramen
                                            establishment, Ramen Ichiraku offers various toppings, such as char siu,
                                            boiled eggs, narutomaki, menma and seaweed. Hidden seaweed is one of the
                                            most popular topping. Ramen Ichiraku is Naruto Uzumaki’s favourite dining
                                            establishment.

                            Hashirama Senju was a member of the famed Senju clan. He himself was hailed as the "God of
                            Shinobi" for his unmatched ninja prowess. Hashirama sought peace for the shinobi world, and
                            to that end founded Konohagakure with his clan, his childhood friend and rival: Madara
                            Uchiha and the Uchiha clan. He would later become the First Hokage (Shodai Hokage, literally
                            meaning: First or Founding Fire Shadow) of Konohagakure. Although he was not able to achieve
                            peace during his lifetime, his legacy and vision for the world would continue to shape the
                            village and the entire shinobi world even after his death.

                            and the Uchiha clan, founded the first shinobi village: Konohagakure. Throughout his
                            lifetime, Tobirama would work tirelessly to achieve political stability and implement the
                            institutions that made the village system work, thus ensuring Konoha's continuity and
                            prosperity. After his brother's death, he would earn the title of Second Hokage ( Nidaime
                            Hokage, literally meaning: Second Fire Shadow).

                            of the Sannin, generations of Konoha shinobi benefited from his wisdom during his lifetime.

                            regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of
                            responsibility. To his students on Team 7, Kakashi teaches the importance of teamwork, a
                            lesson he received, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After
                            the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage (Rokudaime Hokage,
